        Proper breathing is the foundation of yoga practice. These beginner-friendly techniques will help you develop awareness of your breath and create a deeper mind-body connection.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Natural Breath Awareness</h2>
      <p>
        Begin by simply observing your natural breath without trying to change it. Notice the rhythm, depth, and quality of each breath. This awareness forms the basis for all other breathing practices.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Deep Belly Breathing (Diaphragmatic Breathing)</h2>
      <p>
        Place one hand on your belly and one on your chest. Inhale slowly through your nose, allowing your belly to expand. Exhale completely, feeling your belly fall. This technique activates the relaxation response and reduces stress.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Equal Breathing (Sama Vritti)</h2>
      <p>
        Count the length of your inhales and exhales, making them equal in duration. Start with a count of 4, gradually increasing as comfortable. This practice brings balance to the nervous system.
      </p>

      <h2>Practice Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Start with 5-10 minutes daily</li>
        <li>Practice in a comfortable seated position</li>
        <li>Never force or strain your breath</li>
        <li>If you feel dizzy, return to natural breathing</li>
      </ul>
