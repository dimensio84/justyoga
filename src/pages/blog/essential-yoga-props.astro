        The right props can make your yoga practice more accessible, comfortable, and effective. Here's what you need to get started.
      </p>

      <h2>Must-Have Props</h2>
      <h3>1. Yoga Mat</h3>
      <p>
        Your foundation for practice. Look for a mat with good grip and adequate cushioning.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Yoga Blocks</h3>
      <p>
        These bring the floor closer to you in standing poses and provide support in seated positions.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Yoga Strap</h3>
      <p>
        Helps extend your reach in forward folds and binding poses.
      </p>

      <h2>Optional but Helpful</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Bolster for restorative poses</li>
        <li>Blanket for padding and warmth</li>
        <li>Eye pillow for relaxation</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Choosing Quality</h2>
      <p>
        Invest in durable props that will support your practice for years to come. Quality props are safer and more effective than makeshift alternatives.
