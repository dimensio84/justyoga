I've created a comprehensive privacy policy that:
1. Follows standard privacy policy requirements
2. Is specific to the yoga blog's features (progress tracking, photos, etc.)
3. Uses clear, readable language
4. Includes all necessary sections (data collection, usage, rights, etc.)
5. Is styled consistently with the site's design

The policy is accessible through the footer navigation that already exists. You may want to customize the contact email and update the "Last updated" da
